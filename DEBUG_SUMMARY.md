# Relayer Debugging Summary

## Enhanced Logging Findings

### ✅ What's Working:
1. **ABI Loading**: Contract ABIs load correctly from `../../out/`
2. **Transaction Encoding**: Proper encoding with 1930 bytes of data
3. **Function Selector**: Correct `0x812ae400` for `executeTick`
4. **Transaction Sending**: Transaction is sent with proper data
5. **Wallet Balance**: Sufficient ETH (9999.99 ETH)

### ❌ The Issue:
- **Error Code**: `0x21542528` = `InvalidTickProof()`
- **Root Cause**: VDF proof chain validation failing
- **Specific Problem**: Tick 2 is being submitted without proper chain continuity from tick 1

### Debug Log Insights:
```
Gas estimation failed with revert data: 0x21542528
Transaction still sent but reverted with same error
The VDF proof validation in ContinuumVerifier is rejecting the proof
```

### Why It's Failing:
1. Tick 1 was executed during deployment with a specific VDF output
2. Tick 2 must reference tick 1's output as `previousOutput`
3. The relayer is using `bytes32(0)` as previousOutput
4. The VDF proof chain is broken, causing `InvalidTickProof()`

### The Fix Needed:
1. Query the blockchain for tick 1's output
2. Use that as previousOutput for tick 2
3. Ensure VDF proof chain continuity

## Transaction Details Captured:
- **To**: 0xDc64a140Aa3E981100a9becA4E685f962f0cF6C9
- **From**: 0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266
- **Data**: 1930 bytes (properly encoded)
- **Gas**: 2,000,000 limit
- **Status**: Reverted with InvalidTickProof

The enhanced logging successfully shows that the ABI encoding is working correctly. The issue is purely with the VDF proof chain validation logic in the smart contract.
